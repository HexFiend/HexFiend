/*! @class HFController
@brief A central class that acts as the controller layer for HexFiend.framework

HFController acts as the controller layer in the MVC architecture of HexFiend.  The HFController plays several significant central roles, including:
 - Mediating between the data itself (in the HFByteArray) and the views of the data (the @link HFRepresenter HFRepresenters@endlink).
 - Propagating changes to the views.
 - Storing properties common to all Representers, such as the currently diplayed range, the currently selected range(s), the font, etc.
 - Handling text editing actions, such as selection changes or insertions/deletions.

An HFController is the top point of ownership for a HexFiend object graph.  It retains both its ByteArray (model) and its array of Representers (views).

You create an HFController via <tt>[[HFController alloc] init]</tt>.  After that, give it an HFByteArray via setByteArray:, and some Representers via addRepresenter:.  Then insert the Representers' views in a window, and you're done.
